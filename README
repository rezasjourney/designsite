 Install instructions
======================


-----------------
Run Config Script
-----------------

Run the config script in the same directory as this README file, along with the djangosite and optLayout directories:
python config.py

This script will update the paths of the webserver to match the current directory. If you move this directory to somewhere else,
you will need to re-run this script (as well as re-compile optLayout...see below)



-----------------
Install CUDA 5.0
-----------------

Download and install the toolkit from Nvidia:
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-50-archive

CUDA 5.5 may work but hasn't been tested. I use CUDA 5.0.


-----------------
Compile optLayout
-----------------


In the optLayout dir, modify Makefile to have the correct path for nvcc (this should be in your CUDA bin directory),
then type:
make
./optLayout


If the optimizer is running, you should see output that looks something like this:
PT Iteration 81, steps 25, opt -403.26, overall time mean 43.73, pt time mean 30.00, GD imp 0.00 time 0.00 fail 1.00

-----------------
Install & Setup Django
-----------------

Try:
sudo port install py27-django

You will also need to install the python package pytz
sudo pip install pytz


Goto the djangosite directory, type:

python manage.py syncdb



-----------------
Install cpulimit
----------------

Download and compile the latest source from
https://github.com/opsengine/cpulimit

Copy the compiled file to somewhere on your path, for ex. /usr/bin



==================
Running the interface
=================

goto the djangosite dir, type:
python manage.py runserver 8080

in a browser, goto:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/design/select
